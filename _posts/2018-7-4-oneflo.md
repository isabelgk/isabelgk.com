title: Image Analysis of Continuous Flow Reactor

---
I created a MATLAB program to analyze images of a continuous flow reactor to extract information about intrinsic kinetics of the system (such as activation energy and rate constants for the reaction).

This program and the resulting paper won my team first place in our course's final competition. To read more about it, check out the paper [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/10_26_Final_Report.pdf).
