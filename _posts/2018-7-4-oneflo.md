title: Automating Image Analysis of a Reactor

---
The Corning Advanced Flow Lab Reactor is a table-top sized continuous flow reactor. With clear glass plates, the microfluidic channels are visible to the user, allowing colorful reactions to be visualized. To take advantage of this property, my project team and I were interested in seeing whether we could capture useful information quickly and easily. 

My focus throughout the project was on creating a program that would allow us to crop an image of a given colorful reaction and immediately find important and interesting data about the reaction. Since reactions at different temperatures behave differently (some reactions speed up and others slow down depending on their energetic properties), quantifying the visual changes seen in the reactor was a natural next step.

Utilizing a grid-mask method and exploring the HSV colorspace, the MATLAB program I developed can analyze images of a continuous flow reactor to extract information about intrinsic kinetics of the system (such as activation energy and rate constants for the reaction).

For example, the following image of a Wittig intermediate reaction (which goes from red to clear) can be mapped to a percent conversion at a given length along the reactor. Plotting the conversion versus length (and thus time) gives an exponential curve. This curve is common in first-order reactions and can easily be fit to an exponential to extract the kinetic parameters of interest.

This program and the resulting paper won my team first place in our course's final competition. To read more about it, check out the paper [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/10_26_Final_Report.pdf).

Our team started work on automating the grid method by detecting edges of the heart shaped cells of the reactor, but further work would be needed to iron out difficulties when the fluid is too clear to actually distinguish edges versus imperfections in the images.
