## The short story
I like to work on creative and technically challenging projects and learning to do new things!

## The longer story
I am a senior at MIT, graduating in June 2019. I have taken courses in many departments during my time in college, and through it I found myself with a double major in chemical engineering and music with my biggest interests in the intersection of technology and audio-visual applications. 

After my sophomore year, I worked in the H. Sikes lab in the chemical engineering department at MIT to improve paper-based diagnostic tests for tuberculosis and Zika virus. Building computer models and writing scripts to automate lab work sparked my love of computing. In my junior spring, I worked on a chemical engineering lab project that used image analysis to extract kinetic data about color-changing reactions in the Corning Advanced Flow Reactor. That project won first place in our class competition and earned the interest of folks at Corning. After my junior year, I worked as a software engineering intern at edX, the MIT/Harvard based start-up that works to bring education to anyone with Internet access. After that summer experience, I went on to take courses my senior year in the intersection of music and software as well as numerical methods. It was then that I could put my finger on my desire to work with programming and signal processing.

After graduation, I will be working as a software engineer in the Edison Engineering Development Program with GE Healthcare. My primary work will be on image analysis and processing for medical devices.

Outside of programming, playing French horn, and finding new skills to learn, I love to read, knit, and watch baseball.
