I am interested in:
- digital signal processing (filters and oscillators)
- software synthesizers
- interactive and stochastic melodic and harmonic generators

Collected here is a growing list of tools and applications I've developed.

## VCV Rack

[VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) is an virtual modular synthesizer environment with a strong open-source community. I contribute modules to the
plugin library, and you can check out the [source code](https://github.com/IggyLabs/IggyLabsModules), read the [manuals](https://github.com/IggyLabs/IggyLabsModulesManual), 
or [subscribe](https://library.vcvrack.com/?brand=iggy.labs) in the VCV Library to try them out yourself.

## Max4Live

I've made a handful of Max4Live devices for Ableton Live available for free. You can find them at my [maxforlive.com](https://maxforlive.com/profile/user/iggylabs) page.
